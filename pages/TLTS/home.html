					Spicy and flavour, that's who we are! We`ve been working with Tacos
					since 2018 and now we are on the Web. We wanted to get even more
					connected with our clients and expand our business, so we invested in
					a website that we could tell more about our history, bring ourselves
					near to you and engage in virtual features.

				<h3>A little Trivia about Tacos</h3>
				<p>
					Jeffrey M. Pilcher, professor of history at the University of
					Minnesota, has traveled around the world eating tacos. For the past 20
					years, he has investigated the history, politics and evolution of
					Mexican food, including how Mexican silver miners likely invented the
					taco, how Mexican Americans in the Southwest reinvented it, and how
					businessman Glen Bell mass-marketed it to Anglo palates via the
					crunchy Taco Bell shell.

							Pilcher is author and editor, respectively, of the forthcoming
							Planet Taco: A Global History of Mexican Food (Oxford University
							Press) and The Oxford Handbook of Food History. His previous books
							include The Sausage Rebellion: Public Health, Private Enterprise,
							and Meat in Mexico City, 1890-1917 and Que vivan los tamales! Food
							and the Making of Mexican Identity.
